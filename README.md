Sudoku-Solver-Classifier

Problem Statement:
This project aims to develop an advanced Sudoku solver that not only efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles using the AC-3 algorithm and backtracking but also enhances these techniques for better performance. A key feature of our solver is its ability to classify puzzles into different categories, enabling users to understand the complexity of a given puzzle at a glance. We refine the AC-3 algorithm, as well as incorporate additional solving strategies, to optimize our solver's efficiency and effectiveness across different puzzle difficulties.

To make our solver accessible and user-friendly, we design and implement a graphical user interface (GUI). This GUI will not only allow for puzzle input and displaying solutions but also include a HINT button to provide hints for the next cell.
